    matching Response.
  * Collector: using multiple forwarding threads now actually
    behaves as expected.

    targets and encoding it as either EPS-IRIs (for GTPv2) or UMTS-IRIs
    (for GTPv1).

    instead of UMTS-CCs.

    ones defined by libwandder.

    that intercept.

  Changes since 1.0.15 release:
  * Mediator now uses rabbitmq for buffering intercept records before sending
    them on to their respective agency.
  * Mediator now dedicates separate threads to receiving data from each
    collector, and separate threads to forwarding intercepts on to each agency.
    This will make better use of multiple cores on a mediator device.
  * Added support for email interception (as per ETSI TS 102 232-2 standard).
  * Added ability to configure intercepts (of any type) to export only IRIs, or
    only CCs.

  * Fixed bug where encoded raw IP data (e.g. intercepted GTP) was missing a
    preceding LIID when sent to the mediator.
  * Fixed REST API bug that prevented DELETE requests from working for the
    coreserver endpoint.
  * Fixed bug where IPMM IRIs were using the IRI type "IRI-Report" instead of
    the expected "IRI-Continue".
  * Fixed bug where VoIP intercepts would not produce CCs if the corresponding
    SIP session included a 183 message without any RTP port or IP information
    in it.
  * Fixed bug where endtimes for VOIP intercepts could not be modified using
    the REST API.

  * OpenLI provisioner and mediator no longer run as root.
  * Mediators will now send HI1Operation messages to the relevant
    agencies whenever an intercept is activated, deactivated or
    modified.
  * Fix bug where a reconnecting mediator would not receive any
    messages broadcast by a provisioner (such as new LIID mappings).

openli (1.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added authentication layer to the provisioner REST API. If enabled,
    REST API requests must either provide a valid API key or use Digest
    Authentication to confirm that the request has been issued by an
    authorised party.
  * Collectors may now use rabbitmq to "buffer" encoded records before
    sending them to their mediator. The records will be persistently
    buffered to disk, so we are not solely relying on memory to retain
    records for mediators that have failed or disappeared.
  * Added RADIUS-friendly hashing option for collector input sources.
    This option should be used on all inputs that are going to receive
    RADIUS packets. Resolves issues with RADIUS packet ordering that
    required users to decrease the number of processing threads for
    their RADIUS inputs to 1.
  * Added scripts (openli-prov-authsetup.sh and openli-prov-adduser.sh) to
    assist in the creation and management of user credentials for the
    provisioner REST API.
  * Completely refactored mediator code to be easier to maintain. This
    in theory should have no impact on end users, but any code refactor
    may introduce new bugs so we want to make sure users know that we have
    done this.
  * Fixed bug where multiple configuration changes to an agency handover
    would not be applied correctly on the mediator.
  * Fixed crash when a RADIUS user has been removed but still had an
    outstanding request. The crash would occur if we then later saw the
    response.
  * Fixed hanging when collector processes a RADIUS packet that has been
    padded to the minimum frame size.
  * Fix provisioner crashes after expiring an unauthorised client that has
    connected to one of its listening ports.
  * Components that are not using TLS will now immediately exit after
    connecting to a component that is using TLS (and vice versa).
