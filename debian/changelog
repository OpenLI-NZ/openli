openli (1.0.4-1~gtptest02) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Pre-release packaging of 1.0.4 for Datora to use for testing the
    new GTP-based mobile interception capabilities.
  * Fixed issue where GTP sessions were not properly tracked if the request
    and response were seen in the wrong order.

openli (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Greatly improved RADIUS processing performance.
  * Fix bug where IPv6 packets were not being intercepted properly.
  * Add ability to configure the collector to periodically log
    statistics about its internal operations.
  * Keep alive messages now include the OpenLI version string inside
    the LIID, so LEAs can now recognise which version of OpenLI is
    being used.
  * Better memory management of clients connected to the provisioner.
  * Rate limit connection attempts by the mediator to the provisioner.

openli (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix broken ALU shim parsing code.
  * Fix endless collector disconnects if ALU shim or username changes
    for an intercept without a corresponding LIID change.
  * Fix various minor memory leaks that become problematic if a component
    misbehaves.
  * Fix "null" mediation address bug on the provisioner.
  * Fix zeromq deadlock in collector.
  * RADIUS packets are now no longer considered candidates for an IP CC,
    improving performance under high RADIUS load.
  * Improve documentation of ALU translation support.
