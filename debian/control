Description: Central provisioning daemon for an OpenLI system
 OpenLI is a software suite that allows network operators to conduct
 lawful interception of Internet traffic that is compliant with the
 ETSI Lawful Intercept standards.
 This package contains the provisioner component of the OpenLI
 lawful intercept software. The provisioner acts as a centralised
 controller for the deployed OpenLI collectors and mediators.
 Intercepts are configured on the provisioner, which then pushes
 the necessary intercept instructions to any registered collectors
 and mediators.

Description: Mediation daemon for an OpenLI system
 OpenLI is a software suite that allows network operators to conduct
 lawful interception of Internet traffic that is compliant with the
 ETSI Lawful Intercept standards.
 This package contains the mediator component of the OpenLI
 lawful intercept software. The mediator collates intercepted
 (and encoded) packets from the collectors and routes the packets
 to the appropriate law enforcement agency (LEA). The mediator will
 maintain active TCP sessions to all known LEAs for both handover
 interface 2 and 3, using keep-alives as per the ETSI standard.

Description: Collector daemon for an OpenLI system
 OpenLI is a software suite that allows network operators to conduct
 lawful interception of Internet traffic that is compliant with the
 ETSI Lawful Intercept standards.
 This package contains the collector component of the OpenLI lawful
 intercept software. The collector captures packets on one or more
 specified network interfaces, identifies traffic that should be
 intercepted (based on instructions from an OpenLI provisioner),
 encodes the intercepted traffic using the format described in the
 ETSI specifications, and forwards the encoded traffic to the
 appropriate mediator for export to the law enforcement agency that
 requested the intercept.
