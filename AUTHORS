The original OpenLI implementation was written by Shane Alcock, while
working for the WAND network research group at the University of Waikato.

The current lead developer and maintainer of OpenLI is Shane Alcock (still!).

------

OpenLI is an open source project which was developed for public good. We
welcome contributions from our users and friendly programmers and have
dedicated this AUTHORS file to acknowledging the efforts of those who have
contributed something back to the OpenLI project already.

In no particular order, we would like to thank the following people:

 * Tyler Marriner for adding support for encrypting inter-component
   communications using TLS and adding RabbitMQ support to the collector.
 * Neil Tapp for pointing out many bugs and logging inaccuracies.

Apologies to anyone that has made a contribution but we've forgotten to
mention you here -- if this has happened to you, please get in touch with the
project maintainer and let them know about the oversight.
