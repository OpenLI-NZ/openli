# Example OpenLI intercept configuration file
#
# This example file is intended to be used as an example that will explain
# what each of the fields in an OpenLI intercept configuration file actually
# means.
#
# You should use the OpenLI REST API to create and modify your intercept
# configuration files, rather than editing by hand.
# See https://github.com/OpenLI-NZ/openli/wiki/Intercept-Configuration-REST-API
# for instructions on how to do this.

# This intercept demonstrates how to configure an intercept for a target that
# has static IP allocations. The target has both an IPv4 and IPv6 allocation
# that we want to intercept any traffic to or from; each is specified using
# a list item in the 'staticips' list.
#
# Note that both IP ranges have been assigned a session ID of 7. This means
# that any traffic intercepted from either range will be encoded as though
# they are part of the same communication session; this is probably what you
# want in most circumstances.
#
# Once again, a user name is required when specifying the intercept
# even though this target will probably not appear in any AAA traffic seen
# by the collector.
#
# If, during the course of an intercept, the IP ranges assigned to the
# target are modified somehow, you should change the session ID and tell
# the provisioner to reload its configuration (even for IP ranges that remain
# the same as before). This will allow the LEAs to recognise points where the
# target's connectivity has changed.

# If in doubt, talk to your LEA about what value they would like to see in the
# session ID (CIN, as it is known in ETSI) for a target with a static IP and
# what you should do if the static IP assignment changes during the intercept.

# List of active VOIP intercepts.
# To change intercepts for a running OpenLI process, modify the intercept list
# in the config file, then send a SIGHUP to the provisioner process.
#
# In this example, we have three VOIP intercepts running: the first one is 
# for the "Police" intercepting VOIP calls for 'badguy@myisp.com'. The second
# one is for the "Spooks" intercepting VOIP calls for 'target@myisp.com'
#
# The third intercept is being delivered to the collector via X2/X3 so its
# configuration must include the XID that was assigned to the intercept
# when it was first announced via X1. Because intercepts delivered over X2/X3
# should automatically include only the relevant traffic for calls involving
# the target, it is not necessary to include the target's identity in the
# configuration here.
#
# All three intercepts will be routed to the agencies via the mediator that is
# configured with the ID 6001.
