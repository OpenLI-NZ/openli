# This intercept demonstrates how to configure an intercept for a target that
# has static IP allocations. The target has both an IPv4 and IPv6 allocation
# that we want to intercept any traffic to or from; each is specified using
# a list item in the 'staticips' list.
#
# Note that both IP ranges have been assigned a session ID of 7. This means
# that any traffic intercepted from either range will be encoded as though
# they are part of the same communication session; this is probably what you
# want in most circumstances.
#
# Once again, a user name is required when specifying the intercept
# even though this target will probably not appear in any AAA traffic seen
# by the collector.
#
# If, during the course of an intercept, the IP ranges assigned to the
# target are modified somehow, you should change the session ID and tell
# the provisioner to reload its configuration (even for IP ranges that remain
# the same as before). This will allow the LEAs to recognise points where the
# target's connectivity has changed.

# If in doubt, talk to your LEA about what value they would like to see in the
# session ID (CIN, as it is known in ETSI) for a target with a static IP and
# what you should do if the static IP assignment changes during the intercept.
