# Alternative ID string for my network that is used in special HI1 Operations
# messages (which is 5 chars max).

# Write any pcap trace files out to this directory. Only applies to
# intercepts that are configured to use the pcap output mode.
pcapdirectory: /traces/openlipcaps/

# Rotate pcap trace files every 30 minutes. This will close any open trace
# files, flush any remaining output, append the gzip trailers and ensure that
# the rotated file is ready for processing.
# Note that the rotation period is aligned to the epoch, so if you start
# OpenLI at 10:58am, the first rotation will occur at 11:00am, followed by
# one at 11:30am etc.
pcaprotatefreq: 30

# This option specifies how any pcap trace files should be named, using a
# format template much like those used by the C strftime() function.
# All formatting tokens supported by strftime() are also supported here,
# with the addition of '%L' which will be substituted with the intercept's
# LIID and '%s' which will be substituted with the Unix timestamp when the
# file was created.
# If not specified, the default template of 'openli_%L_%s' will be used.
# Note the ".pcap.gz" will be appended to any compressed pcap files, and
# ".pcap" will be appended to any uncompressed pcap files.
pcapfilename: example-%L-%d%m%y-%H%M%S

# Set the gzip compression level to be applied when writing pcap files.
# If set to zero, then files will not be compressed. The default value is
# 1. and cannot be set higher than 9. Higher compression levels will require
# significantly more CPU to compress, so we do not recommend using values
# higher than 1 without a very good reason.
pcapcompress: 1

# If you wish to encrypt your internal OpenLI communications between
# components, these three options must be point to valid certificates / keys
# to be used for TLS encryption. Make sure that if you enable TLS on
# one OpenLI component, that you also do so on all of the others.
#
# Leave these commented out for unencrypted inter-component communications.
# Note that if you wish you use SSL authentication for RabbitMQ (see below),
# then you will need to provide these options regardless (and therefore will
# have to accept encrypted inter-component communication).
#
# The TLS certificates and keys can be generated using PQC cryptography algorithms, based on OQS-Provider list of algorithms. 
# As well, is required to modify the "Openssl.cnf" file to add the desired QS Key Exchange Methods (KEM) desired.

# To receive records from collectors that are using RabbitMQ to persist
# unacknowledged data, you will need to provide the credentials necessary
# for the mediator to authenticate against the RabbitMQ server running on the

# The password to use for authenticating against the RabbitMQ virtual
# host that is handling internal message buffering for the mediator.

# virtual host and `openli.nz` user -- packaged installs should NOT need
# to set this config option.

# If set to 'no', intercepted packets streamed to this mediator by the
# collectors will be treated as unencrypted -- this may be desirable for
# performance reasons. Make sure you set the corresponding option on the
# collectors as well.
