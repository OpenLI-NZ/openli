# Rotate pcap trace files every 30 minutes. This will close any open trace
# files, flush any remaining output, append the gzip trailers and ensure that
# the rotated file is ready for processing.
# Note that the rotation period is aligned to the epoch, so if you start
# OpenLI at 10:58am, the first rotation will occur at 11:00am, followed by
# one at 11:30am etc.

# If you wish to encrypt your internal OpenLI communications between
# components, these three options must be point to valid certificates / keys
# to be used for TLS encryption. Make sure that if you enable TLS on
# one OpenLI component, that you also do so on all of the others.
#
# Leave these commented out for unencrypted inter-component communications.
# Note that if you wish you use SSL authentication for RabbitMQ (see below),
# then you will need to provide these options regardless (and therefore will
# have to accept encrypted inter-component communication).

# To receive records from collectors that are using RabbitMQ to persist
# unacknowledged data, you will need to provide the credentials necessary

# If set to 'no', intercepted packets streamed to this mediator by the
# collectors will be treated as unencrypted -- this may be desirable for
# performance reasons. Make sure you set the corresponding option on the
# collectors as well.
