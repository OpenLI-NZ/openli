/** The code in this source file defines types and methods used by an
 *  "LEA send" thread for the OpenLI mediator.
 *  Each agency that is configured with the OpenLI provisioner will be
 *  handled using a separate instance of one of these threads.
 *
 *  The core functionality of an LEA send thread is to:
 *    - establish the handovers to the agency for both HI2 and HI3.
 *    - consume any IRIs or CCs for LIIDs that belong to the agency from
 *      their respective internal RMQ queue, placing them in an export
 *      buffer for the corresponding handover.
 *    - send data from the export buffer over the handover socket, when the
 *      LEA end is able to receive data.
 *    - send periodic keepalives on each handover, as required.
